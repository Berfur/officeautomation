# Scripts for office automation
I mostly work in an office environment (windows, email, word processing, etc.). I have *a lot* of retetitive tasks, so I try to automate most of the trivial tasks.

Most of it is performed by [Espanso](https://espanso.org/), a wonderful cross platform application for text expanding by [Federico Terzi](https://federicoterzi.com/).

I use it and some phyton scripting.

# What's in there?
* a collection of [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) templates, automated by Espanso. I use [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)'s flavour because I think it's complete.

* shortcuts for dealing with other tasks like writing emails (a time-of-the-day aware shortcut for greetings).

## Installation
You have to install Espanso at least and possibly Python too (for the scripts).
Simply download the yml file inside your .espanso/match directory. Obviously python files go to: .espanso/scripts directory
