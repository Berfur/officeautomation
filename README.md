#The power of automation and templating
*Templating* is an effortless strategy to create patterns of information to simplify tasks (both simple and complex). It's mainly an intellectual task, and a very personal one. Some templates you can borrow, but you can't use them without understanding them. For example, you can copy a markdown or todo.txt template. But you can't use them if you don't know markdown or todo.txt syntax.  
*Automation* is the practice to have a repetitive task (providing the correct template for example) the most effortless way possible. It does not matter if you automate electronically, mechanically, humanly or informatically. Do as you please, the best way for you. 

# Scripts for office automation
I mostly work in an office environment (windows, email, word processing, etc.). I have *a lot* of repetitive tasks, so I try to automate most of the trivial tasks.

Most of it is performed by [Espanso](https://espanso.org/), a wonderful cross platform application for text expanding by [Federico Terzi](https://federicoterzi.com/).

I use it and some phyton scripting.

# What's in there?
* a collection of [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) templates, automated by Espanso. I use [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)'s flavour because I think it's complete.

* shortcuts for dealing with other tasks like writing emails (a time-of-the-day aware shortcut for greetings).

## Installation
You have to install Espanso at least and possibly Python too (for the scripts).
Simply download the yml file inside your .espanso/match directory. Obviously python files go to: .espanso/scripts directory
