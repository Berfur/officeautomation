# Scripts for office automation
Full disclosure: I am lazy, so I try to make my pc do all the work. Here it's what I came up with.

Most of it is for [Espanso](https://espanso.org/), a wonderful cross platform application for text expanding by [Federico Terzi](https://federicoterzi.com/).

# What's in there?
You write in [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)? Or even better, you use [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)? There are some shortcuts to simplify your life.

You write a lot of emails, text and so on? Look inside, and find something useful, for example a shortcut to start your greeting with the correct time-related formula (Good Morning, good evening), based on your pc clock.

## Installation
Espanso: simply download the yml file inside your .espanso/match directory. Obviously python files go to: .espanso/scripts directory
